\arguments{
\item{CplexPath}{Path to executable cplex file - always required}

\item{netFile}{Filename of the prior knowledge network - always required or set as NULL to run CARNIVAL built-in example}

\item{measFile}{Filename of the measurement file (here DoRothEA normalised enrichment scores) - always required or set as NULL to run CARNIVAL built-in example}

\item{inputFile}{Filename of the list for target of perturbation - optional or set as NULL to run CARNIVAL built-in example}

\item{weightFile}{Filename of the additional weight (here PROGENy pathway score) - optional or set as NULL to run CARNIVAL built-in example}

\item{CARNIVAL_example}{Number of built-in CARNIVAL example (1=Toy Model,2=SBVimprove-EGF,3=TG-GATEs-APAP) or set as NULL to use user-defined input files}

\item{Result_dir}{Specify directory name to store results}

\item{inverseCR}{Execute the inverse CARNIVAL pipeline (logical T/F)}

\item{parallelIdx1}{First index number suitable for parallelisation (numeric - set to 1 by default)}

\item{parallelIdx2}{Second index number suitable for parallelisation (numeric - set to 1 by default)}

\item{nodeID}{Define the input format of nodes in the network (either 'uniprot' or 'gene' symbol)}

\item{UP2GS}{For plotting: define if Uniprot ID will be converted to gene symbols for better readability (logical T/F)}

\item{DOTfig}{For plotting: define if DOT figure will be exported in the result folder (logical T/F)}

\item{Export_all}{Define if all CPLEX variables results will be exported into files (logical T/F) - only recommended for debugging}

\item{timelimit}{CPLEX parameter: Time limit of CPLEX optimisation (in seconds)}

\item{mipGAP}{CPLEX parameter: Allowed gap of accepted solution comparing to the best solution (fraction; default: 0.05 = 5 percents)}

\item{poolrelGAP}{CPLEX parameter: Allowed relative gap of accepted solution comparing within the pool of accepted solution (fraction; default: 0.0001)}

\item{limitPop}{CPLEX parameter: Allowed number of solutions to be generated (default: 500)}

\item{poolCap}{CPLEX parameter: Allowed number of solution to be kept in the pool of solution (default: 100)}

\item{poolIntensity}{CPLEX parameter: Intensity of solution searching (0,1,2,3,4 - default: 4)}

\item{poolReplace}{CPLEX parameter: Replacement strategy of solutions in the pool (0,1,2 - default: 2 = most diversified solutions)}

\item{alphaWeight}{Objective function: weight for mismatch penalty (default: 1 - will only be applied once measurement file only contains discrete values)}

\item{betaWeight}{Objective function: weight for node penalty (defaul: 0.2)}
}
\value{
The networks and predicted node activities from the CARNIVAL pipeline as a variable which are also saved in the destined result folder
}
\description{
Run CARNIVAL pipeline using to the user-provided list of inputs or run CARNIVAL built-in examples
Note: The pipeline requires either all required user-defined input variables (netFile and measFile) are set to NULL or CARNIVAL_example is set to NULL to execute
}
