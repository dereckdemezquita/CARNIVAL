### InputFile for CARNIVAL 

### Note: Please do not change the format i.e. unique variable name separated by space-equal_sign-space ' = '

## ========================================================== ##

## Specify paths to files or choose built-in CARNIVAL example

# Specify path to executable cplex file
CplexPath = ~/Applications/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1271/cplex/bin/x86-64_osx

# Assign CARNIVAL input files (can leave them as they are if running provided CARNIVAL example)

# Prior knowledge network file and measurement file e.g. DoRothEA normalised enrichment scores (always required)
netFile = your_network_file.sif
measFile = your_measurement_file.txt

# Targets of perturbation file and additional weight file e.g. PROGENy pathway score (optional)
inputFile = your_input_target_file.txt
weightFile = your_node_weight_file.txt

# Choose a CARNIVAL provided example (or set to NULL if using your own inputs)
CARNIVAL_example = 2

## ========================================================== ##

## Choose CARNIVAL settings

# Specify a name for result directory; if NULL, then date and time will be used by default
Result_dir = Results_CARNIVAL

# Running inverse causal reasoning version?
inverseCR = F

# Running parallelised version? 
parallelCR = F

# Specify whether the nodes are in 'uniprot' ID or 'gene' symbol format  
nodeID = uniprot

## ========================================================== ##
 
## Plotting-related setting (doesn't affect the optimisation process)

# Convert UniProtIDs to Gene Symbols in the plotting step?
UP2GS = T

# Write DOT figure? (can be visualised by e.g. GraphViz)
DOTfig = T

# Export all ILP variables or not; if F, only predicted node values and sif file will be written
Export_all = F

## ========================================================== ##
 
## Set CPLEX stopping criteria and parameters

## Note: Only recommeneded to change time limit for default cases

# set time limit for cplex optimisation (in seconds)
timelimit = 180

# Allowed gap error in proportion to the best estimated integer solution
mipGAP = 0.05

# Allowed gap error in relative to the pool of best solution
poolrelGAP = 0.0001

# Limit the number of populated solutions after identified best solution
limitPop = 500

# Limit the pool size to store populated solution
poolCap = 100

# Select search intensity [0 default/ 1 to 4]
poolIntensity = 4

# Select replacement strategy of the pool solution [0 default/ 1 to 2]
poolReplace = 2

# Constant coefficient for fitting error in the objective function in case TF activities are not assigned [default 1]
alphaWeight = 1

# Relative coefficient of model size to fitting error in the objective function [default 0.2]
betaWeight = 0.2
